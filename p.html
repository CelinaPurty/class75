 <P>Every body in the universe exerts a gravitational influence on every other body. That includes human bodies, but the force is more important between more massive bodies, such as planets and stars. 
    The gravitational force between two bodies on Earth is negligible, but not the attractive force between a body and the planet itself.
    It's the glue that prevents everything that isn't tied down from floating off into space.
    In general, two bodies exert a gravitational force on each other directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:</P>

<p>The Moon’
s gravity affects us so much that it is elongating our days. Scientists predict that some 1.4 billion years ago, a day on Earth was only 18 hours long. This is because the moon revolved much closer to us at that time than it does today. In the next 100 years, the moon will move even further away, and a “day” will become 1.5 milliseconds longer.
Our closest and most loyal neighbor is gradually abandoning us as a consequence of it causing tides on our planet. The moon is so close to the Earth that it pulls the water facing its surface towards it. The attraction causes the water to bulge and spur tidal waves. In fact, the moon doesn’
t merely pull the water facing it, but also the Earth from the water diametrically opposite to it. As the Earth’
s surface is pulled away, the water swells on the other side.</p>
